        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Mix the flour and the salt in a large bowl.</li>
          <li>Whisk in half the milk until it becomes a smooth batter. This prevents lumps. Whisk in the rest of the milk.</li>
          <li>Whisk in the eggs until combined.</li>
          <li>Add the water and stir. The more water you add, the softer and more elastic the pancakes will be.</li>
          <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat (I go with a 7-7.5 out of 12) and wait for it to become hot.</li>
          <li>Add a tablespoon of butter to the pan and make sure to cover the entire bottom. If it turns brown you should lower the heat. Pour in half a soup ladel of pancake batter and swirl it around the pan until the bottom is covered. Fry for a couple of minutes</li>
          <li>Once you are satisfied with the color, flip the pancake over on its other side. Fry for a shorter amount than the first side.</li>
          <li>When the pancake is ready, transfer it to a plate where you will stack all of your pancakes. Then repeat the process (steps 6-8) until no batter remains.</li>
          <li>Serve with whipped cream and jam or sugar and lemon juice.</li>
        </ol>
